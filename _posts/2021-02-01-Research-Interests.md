    My work focuses on autonomous information collection using vision and LiDAR sensors equipped on the robots 
    for localization and mapping, environmental monitoring, and security and surveillance. 
    I also focus on scene understanding problems that perceive geometry and semantic information to improve the autonomy of robots.
    The relevant fields of my interesting research are
    <b>Visual/LiDAR SLAM, Multi-sensor fusion, Semantic mapping, 3D modeling, Robotics, Computer Vision, Deep learning, Autonomous Vehicles</b>.

    I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Information Engineering from 
    <b><a href="http://english.zucc.edu.cn/"> Zhejiang University City College </a></b> in 2015, 
    and Master of Science's degree in Electrical Engineering from 
    <b><a href="https://www.colostate.edu/"> Colorado State University</a></b> in 2018. 
    After that, I joined <b>Vision based automation science and engineering (<a href="https://www.robotics-hitsz.com/"> VBASE </a>) Lab </b> in Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, as a Research Assistant with Prof. <a href="https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/teacher/view/id-1304.html#opennewwindow"> Xin Jiang </a>.
    During that time, I am focusing on solving problems about applying simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in autonomous mobile manipulator robots. 
    I am devoted to multi-sensor fusion part, 
    such as fusing SLAM system with sensors like wheel-encoders, kinematics, 2D LiDAR, and Stereo Camera
    to enhance the accuracy and robustness of SLAM system working in construction scenarios.
    I am also focusing on the SLAM combined with object and layout understanding. 
    Currently, I join <b>Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Research Institute (Futian), The Chinese University of Hong Kong</b>,
    as a Research Assistant, advised by Prof. <a href="http://ri.cuhk.edu.hk/yhliu"> Yun-Hui Liu</a>. 
    I am mainly focusing on LiDAR-based SLAM and reconstruction, as well as motion planning for mobile manipulator robots.
